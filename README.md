## What is it?
Beautiful setup with vertical tabs for firefox.

Supports white and dark theme.

## Installation Instructions
1) Paste the contents of sidebery.css into the styles editor of the Sidebery extension.
2) Paste the contents of userChrome.css into the userChrome.css file located in the "chrome" folder of your firefox profile(about:profiles). If there is no such folder, create the folder and file yourself.
3) In the sidebery settings file you can find the settings that I use for a more comfortable and beautiful use of the extension.

The Betterfox overrides file contains the changes that I make to the betterfox profile for more comfortable use.
